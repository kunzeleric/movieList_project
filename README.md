# The Movie - TMDB API's Movie Search

A project developed to practice React and API consumption skills. 
It was inspired in one of the projects developed in the Web Full Stack Course I was taking, but I decided to give a personal touch :)

## Technologies & Dependencies

- ReactJS
- TMDB API
- React Router
  
## Take Aways

I had lots of fun developing this project, because I wanted to go a little further than the original proposed project.
In the end I was able to manipulate more data from the API and bring the user a wider choice of search possibilities.
It was a very important project, because I could grow my React abilities and also understand more about data consumption from an API.

## Setup

After cloning or downloading the project, use the commands below in the terminal.

```bash
  cd my-project
  npm install my-project
  npm run dev
```
